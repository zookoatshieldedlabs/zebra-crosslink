# The `zebra-crosslink` Book

`zebra-crosslink` is [Shielded Labs](https://shieldedlabs.net)'s implementation of *Zcash
Crosslink*, a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus protocol for [Zcash](https://z.cash/). Refer to the [Rationale, Scope, and Goals](design/scoping.md) to understand our effort. See [our roadmap](https://shieldedlabs.net/roadmap/) for current progress status.

## Prototype Workshops

Shielded Labs hosts semi-regular workshops as the prototype progresses; if you're interested in joining, get in touch!

## Prototype Codebase

***Status:*** This codebase is an early prototype, and suitable for the adventurous or curious who
want to explore rough experimental releases.

This [`zebra-crosslink`](https://github.com/ShieldedLabs/zebra-crosslink) codebase is a fork of
[`zebra`](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra).
 If you simply want a modern Zcash production-ready mainnet node, please use that upstream node.

### Build and Usage

To try out the software and join the testnet, see [Build and Usage](user/build-and-usage.md).

### Design and Implementation

This book is entirely focused on this implementation of *Zcash Crosslink*. For general Zebra usage or development documentation, please refer to the official [Zebra Book](https://zebra.zfnd.org/). We strive to document the [Design](design.md) and [Implementation](implementation.md) changes in this book.

## Maintainers

`zebra-crosslink` is maintained by [Shielded Labs](https://shieldedlabs.net), makers of fine Zcash software.

## Contributing

Our github issues are open for feedback. We will accept pull requests after the [prototyping phase
is done](https://ShieldedLabs.net/roadmap).
